 * @brief Use this method to query whether a state change from initialization state to tracking state can be performed.

 * @discussion For Wikitude's instant tracking algorithm, this function currently always returns YES because the state change is always possible. For ARKit this function performs a hit test internally to check whether the state can be switched or not. Theoretically, the state change could still be unsuccessful after this function has indicated otherwise due to a hit test position that differs and a temporal delay between the two calls. Practically, this is the best we can do and it works consistently.
